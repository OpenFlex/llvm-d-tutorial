llvm-d-tutorial
===============

Port of the LLVM Tutorial to D. I didn't keep each step indivually, just the finished tutorial.

Compiling
=========
You need LLVM 3.0 installed on your UNIX, Linux or Mac OS X system. For now, I didn't found a fix for the linking problems on Windows.

Just use the supplied Makefile to compile the tutorial.
